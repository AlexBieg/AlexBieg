# Hey, I'm Alex! 👨🏻‍💻
I'm a fullstack engineer with a passion for using technology for good. 'Good' can imply a lot of things. To me it simply means that at the end of the day the people who use the things I build are better off. From helping rebuild a website for the anti-recidivism non-profit [Unloop](https://un-loop.org) to making a silly [D&D manager](https://github.com/AlexBieg/dnd-manager) to play games with my friends, I try to make sure everything I build has a positive impact.

Lately I've been interested in React, Electron, and GraphQL
